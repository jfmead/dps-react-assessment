Tound a way to copy the DPS repo into one I created...and then read that I could just use fork which was way simpler than git clone, removing git and then adding it to my repo.

I spent 5 hours off and on attempting to figure out how to grap data using the external API.

12/28 11:00am-1:00pm 
Figured out how to get the beers and breweries to show up. Turns how I needed to do res.data.entries. Spent a long time reading about grabbing objects. Can't figure out how to grab images from the API. They are nested objects... 

10:00pm-midnight 
Working on pagination. Will attempt inifinite scroll if I have time.

Got images to show up with beers and breweries. Had to create a conditional because not all beers/breweries have images. Used a placeholder for those that don't.
